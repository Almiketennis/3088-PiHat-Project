PiHat Description:
The PiHat chosen for this project is a temperature sensor designed to output a range of temperatures to the user using a series of three LED's, and one added LED to show whether the PiHat is on or not. The three temperature ranges are between 0 degrees celcius and 19 degrees celcius, 20 degrees celcius and 39 degrees celcius, and finally any temperature above 40 degrees celcius. One LED will turn on for the first range of temperatures, the second LED will turn on for the second range of temperatures, and finally the last LED will turn on when the temperature reaches above 40 degrees celcius. The LED's are set up with their own comparator circuits that will ensure they turn on for their desired temperatures.
